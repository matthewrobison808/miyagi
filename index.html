    <h1>A Few Things about Mr Miyagi</h1>
    <h2>This is Mr Miyagi the cat, not the martial arts teacher from "Karate Kid".</h2>

    <h3>What Mr Miyagi Likes</h3>
    <p>Here are few things that Mr Miyagi likes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sleep. In order of most preferred sleeping arrangement to the least:
          <ol>
            <li>In his cat bowl in front of the heater</li>
            <li>On a warm lap</li>
            <li>Basking in a ray of warm sunshine</li>
            <li>On the back of the couch next to a wide window</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Eating. Once he was a somewhat picky eater, but now he has broadened his eating horizons to include:
          <ul>
          <li>Standard Kibble of the organic variety</li>
          <li>Tuna from his daily tuna water</li>
          <li>Yogurt</li>
          <li>Cat grass freshly grown from seed</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Playing. There is one thing that sums up how Mr Miyagi likes to play; diversity. Every skillset needs a different toy if he is to become a well trained master.
          <ul>
            <li>"Sexy Girlfriend" trains Miyagi how to burrow under a rug and fish for critters</li>
            <li>"Exotica" trains him on how to leap into the air and perform backflips and other aerial manuvers. </li>
            <li>Blue tinsle balls train him on accuracy. How to leap from a hiding place and pounce on his prey.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Other Skills of Mr Miyagi</h3>
      <p>No cat should be limited to number of tricks they can learn. This is why Mr Miyagi uses the toilet instead of the litter box to go to the bathroom.</p>
